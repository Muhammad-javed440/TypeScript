// The code above will produce an index error because the array
//  "my_family" only has five elements with indices from 0 to 4. Trying to
// access "my_family[6]" will result in an error because there is no element 
//  at that index. To fix this issue, simply change the number in the square brackets  
// to a valid index for the array. 
// it also called international error
